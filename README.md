# Amazon Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - S4DS Task

This repository contains the code and findings from an exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the Amazon Dataset. The analysis was conducted as part of the S4DS Task by Aryan Rajpurkar.

## Overview

In this project, the Amazon Products dataset was analyzed to gain insights into various aspects of the products available on Amazon. The analysis covered data cleaning, handling missing values, data visualization, and correlation analysis. The goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

## Files

- `amazon-dataset-eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- `Amazon_Products.csv`: The original dataset used for analysis.

## Project Steps

1. Importing Data and Libraries: Loading the dataset and necessary libraries for analysis.
2. Filling/Dropping Null Values: Handling missing values for various columns in the dataset.
3. Converting Specific Columns: Converting specific columns to suitable data types for analysis.
4. Handling Price Outlier: Identifying and handling an outlier in the 'price' column.
5. EDA: Exploratory data analysis covering various aspects of the dataset:
   - Distribution of Prices
   - Number of Products vs Top Manufacturers
   - Correlation between Review Ratings and Price
   - Availability of Products
   - Most Frequently Used Words in Description
   - Top Categories of Sales
   - Price vs Availability
   - Most Expensive Products
   - Related Products Analysis
   - Number of Reviews vs Number of Answered Questions
   - Distribution of Products Across Categories

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud) if not already installed.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `amazon-dataset-eda.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis.
